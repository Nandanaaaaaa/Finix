FiNIX Development Plan: 24-Hour MVP (Modular & GCP-Centric)
This plan assumes a single developer or a small team working in parallel. Time estimates are aggressive and require focused effort.

Overall Strategy & Best Practices:

MVP First: Focus ruthlessly on the core "Talk to Your Money" feature (Gemini + Fi MCP + basic chat UI). All other features are secondary.

Serverless First: Leverage GCP's managed services (Firebase, Cloud Run, Secret Manager, Vertex AI) to minimize infrastructure setup and maintenance.

Iterative Development: Build small pieces, test them immediately, and integrate.

Error Handling (Basic): Implement try-catch blocks and log errors to Cloud Logging. Don't build complex error reporting systems for the MVP.

Secrets Management: Always use Secret Manager for API keys and sensitive information.

GCP CLI: Be comfortable with gcloud commands for faster deployment and management.

Continuous Learning: Be prepared to quickly consult GCP documentation for specific API calls or service configurations.

Module 0: Pre-requisites & Environment Setup (2 Hours)
Goal: Lay the foundational GCP project and local development environment.

Key GCP Services: Google Cloud Project, Firebase, IAM, Cloud SDK.

Tasks:

Create Google Cloud Project:

Go to Google Cloud Console.

Create a new project (e.g., finix-ai-assistant).

Enable Essential GCP APIs:

In the GCP Console, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & Services".

Enable:

Firebase Management API

Cloud Run API

Vertex AI API (for Gemini)

Secret Manager API

(Optional, for later) Cloud Storage API, Google Sheets API, Cloud Functions API, Cloud Pub/Sub API, Cloud Natural Language API.

Install Google Cloud SDK & Firebase CLI:

gcloud init (authenticate and set your new project as default).

npm install -g firebase-tools

Initialize Firebase Project:

In your project root: firebase init

Select Hosting and Firestore (even if you don't use Firestore immediately, it's good to have it configured for potential future use). Link to your new GCP project.

For Hosting, set build as the public directory and configure as a single-page app.

Create Service Account for Cloud Run:

In GCP Console, "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".

Create a new service account (e.g., finix-cloud-run-sa).

Grant it initial roles: Vertex AI User, Secret Manager Secret Accessor. Add more as needed.

Local Project Setup:

Create project directories: mkdir finix && cd finix

npx create-react-app frontend (for React UI)

mkdir backend && cd backend && npm init -y (for Node.js API)

Install backend dependencies: npm install express axios @google-cloud/vertexai dotenv

Install frontend dependencies: cd ../frontend && npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer recharts (or Chart.js)

Configure Tailwind CSS in frontend.

Success Criteria: GCP project created, necessary APIs enabled, local dev environment set up, Firebase initialized, service account created.

Module 1: Core Backend API (Cloud Run & Gemini) (6 Hours)
Goal: Develop the serverless backend that processes user queries, interacts with Gemini, and sets up for Fi MCP integration.

Key GCP Services: Cloud Run, Vertex AI (Gemini), Secret Manager, Cloud Logging.

Tasks:

Node.js Express Server (Basic):

In backend/server.js, create a basic Express app.

Listen on process.env.PORT || 8080.

Add CORS middleware.

Create a /health endpoint for testing.

Gemini API Integration (Vertex AI SDK):

Initialize Vertex AI client in server.js.

Create a /api/chat endpoint.

This endpoint will receive user text.

Call Gemini API with the user's query.

Return Gemini's text response.

Define Gemini Tools (Function Calling):

Crucial Step: Define functionDeclarations for tools like getNetWorth, getSIPPerformance, calculateLoanAffordability.

Provide clear description and parameters (even if empty initially).

Integrate toolConfig when starting the Gemini chat session.

Implement basic if (call) logic to detect tool calls and log them (actual Fi MCP calls come in Module 3).

Dockerfile for Cloud Run:

Create backend/Dockerfile as provided in the previous response.

Secret Manager Setup (Fi MCP Placeholder):

gcloud secrets create FI_MCP_ENDPOINT --data-file=- <<<"https://mcp.fi.money:8080/mcp/stream" (or your actual endpoint)

gcloud secrets create FI_MCP_CLIENT_ID --data-file=- <<<"your-fi-mcp-client-id" (if Fi MCP uses one)

gcloud secrets create FI_MCP_API_KEY --data-file=- <<<"your-fi-mcp-api-key" (if Fi MCP uses one, or placeholder for the temporary token mechanism)

Grant Secret Manager Secret Accessor role to finix-cloud-run-sa.

Initial Cloud Run Deployment:

cd backend

gcloud run deploy finix-backend --source . --platform managed --region [YOUR_GCP_REGION] --allow-unauthenticated --service-account finix-cloud-run-sa@[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com --update-secrets FI_MCP_ENDPOINT=FI_MCP_ENDPOINT:latest,FI_MCP_CLIENT_ID=FI_MCP_CLIENT_ID:latest,FI_MCP_API_KEY=FI_MCP_API_KEY:latest

Note the service URL.

Test Backend: Use Postman/curl to test /health and /api/chat endpoints. Check Cloud Logging for your Cloud Run service logs.

Success Criteria: Cloud Run service deployed and accessible, Gemini API integrated, basic chat responses received, tool calls logged (even if not yet executed).

Module 2: Frontend UI & Basic Chat (4 Hours)
Goal: Create a functional React chat interface that communicates with the Cloud Run backend.

Key GCP Services: Firebase Hosting.

Tasks:

React Chat Component:

In frontend/src/App.js (or a new Chat.js component).

Create an input field, a "Send" button, and a display area for messages.

Use useState for chatHistory (array of { sender: 'user'|'ai', text: '...' }) and currentMessage.

Implement sendMessage function to send currentMessage to your Cloud Run /api/chat endpoint using axios or fetch.

Update chatHistory with user message and AI response.

Add a loading spinner while waiting for AI response.

Basic Styling (Tailwind/Material UI):

Apply minimal styling to make the chat readable and responsive.

Connect Frontend to Cloud Run:

In your React app, set the Cloud Run service URL as an environment variable (e.g., REACT_APP_API_URL).

cd frontend && npm run build

Deploy Frontend to Firebase Hosting:

cd frontend

firebase deploy --only hosting (This will deploy the build folder).

Test End-to-End: Access your Firebase Hosting URL and test the chat functionality.

Success Criteria: React app deployed and accessible, user can type, send messages, and receive responses from Gemini via Cloud Run.

Module 3: Authentication & Fi MCP Integration (6 Hours)
Goal: Secure the application with Firebase Auth and integrate real financial data from Fi MCP via Gemini's tool calls.

Key GCP Services: Firebase Authentication, Cloud Run, Secret Manager.

Tasks:

Firebase Authentication (Frontend):

In frontend/src/index.js or App.js, initialize Firebase client-side SDK.

Create simple login/signup components using Firebase Auth (e.g., email/password, Google Sign-In).

Implement onAuthStateChanged to manage user session.

When a user is logged in, get their ID token: await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken().

Modify sendMessage function to include this ID token in the Authorization: Bearer header of requests to Cloud Run.

Firebase Authentication (Backend - Cloud Run):

In backend/server.js, install Firebase Admin SDK: npm install firebase-admin.

Initialize firebase-admin (it will pick up credentials automatically on Cloud Run).

Implement a middleware to verify Firebase ID tokens on all protected API routes (e.g., /api/chat).

Update Cloud Run Deployment:

gcloud run deploy finix-backend ... --no-allow-unauthenticated (remove public access).

This makes your Cloud Run service accessible only to authenticated Firebase users.

Fi MCP Integration (Backend - Cloud Run):

In backend/server.js, implement the functions that Gemini will call (e.g., callFiMCPForNetWorth(), callFiMCPForSIPs()).

These functions will:

Retrieve Fi MCP endpoint/keys from process.env.

Handle the Fi MCP passcode authentication flow (this might require a user prompt on the frontend that sends the passcode to a specific backend endpoint, which then gets the temporary token and stores it securely for the session, or re-prompts if expired). This is the most complex part of Fi MCP integration.

Make axios calls to the Fi MCP server with the temporary token and relevant query parameters.

Parse Fi MCP's JSON response.

Integrate Fi MCP calls into Gemini Tooling:

When Gemini's functionCall is detected (e.g., getNetWorth), call your callFiMCPForNetWorth() function.

Pass the result back to Gemini using chat.sendMessage({ functionResponse: ... }) so Gemini can formulate a natural language answer.

Test Authentication & Fi MCP:

Test user login/signup on the frontend.

Verify that API calls fail without a valid token.

Ask questions like "What's my net worth?" and "Which SIP is underperforming?" to trigger Fi MCP calls and observe Gemini's responses. Check Cloud Logging for successful Fi MCP interactions.

Success Criteria: Users can log in, API calls are authenticated, Gemini successfully triggers and receives data from Fi MCP, and provides intelligent responses based on that data.

Module 4: Advanced Features & Polish (4 Hours - Stretch Goals)
Goal: Enhance the user experience with voice input, data visualization, and basic reporting/alerts.

Key GCP Services: Google Speech-to-Text (optional direct API), Cloud Storage, Google Sheets API, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions.

Tasks:

Voice Input (1-2 hours):

Option A (Recommended for MVP): Use browser's SpeechRecognition API directly in React. Convert speech to text, then send text to Cloud Run.

Option B (More complex): If needed, implement audio recording in React, send audio blob to a new Cloud Run endpoint. This endpoint calls Google Speech-to-Text API, gets text, then forwards to /api/chat.

Basic Data Visualization (1-2 hours):

Backend (Cloud Run): When Gemini's response implies a chart (e.g., net worth over time), structure the relevant data from Fi MCP into a simple JSON array (e.g., [{ date: '...', value: '...' }]) and include it in the AI response JSON.

Frontend (React): Create a component (e.g., NetWorthChart.js) using Recharts/Chart.js.

Conditionally render this chart component in your chat display if the AI response contains the structured chart data.

Basic Reporting/Export (1-2 hours):

Backend (Cloud Run):

Create a new endpoint (e.g., /api/export-sheet) that fetches data from Fi MCP.

Use Google Sheets API (Node.js client) to create a new spreadsheet and populate it. Return the sheet URL.

(Stretch) For PDF: Use Puppeteer (install in your Cloud Run container, might need more memory) to render HTML (populated with Fi data) to PDF. Upload to Cloud Storage and return a signed URL.

Frontend (React): Add "Export to Sheet" and "Generate PDF Report" buttons.

Simple Alerts (0.5-1 hour):

Backend (Cloud Run): After processing Fi MCP data, if a condition is met (e.g., balance < threshold), publish a message to a Pub/Sub topic.

GCP Console: Create a Pub/Sub topic (e.g., finix-alerts).

Cloud Function: Write a simple Node.js Cloud Function triggered by this Pub/Sub topic. Its job is to log the alert or send a dummy email (using a simple mailer library, not a full notification service for MVP).

Success Criteria: Voice input works, basic charts display, export/report buttons initiate a process (even if simple).

Module 5: Final Deployment & Testing (2 Hours)
Goal: Ensure all components are deployed and working together, perform final testing, and prepare for handover.

Tasks:

Final Code Review & Cleanup:

Remove any debug console.log statements.

Ensure all API keys are in Secret Manager.

Verify .env files are not committed.

Full Deployment:

cd backend && gcloud run deploy finix-backend ... --no-allow-unauthenticated (ensure authentication is enforced).

cd frontend && npm run build

firebase deploy (deploys both hosting and any Firebase functions if you added them, otherwise just hosting).

End-to-End Testing:

Test the full user flow: login, chat, asking financial questions, triggering charts/reports (if implemented).

Test on different devices/browsers for responsiveness.

Check Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for any errors or performance issues.

Basic Documentation:

Create a README.md in your project root.

Include setup instructions (GCP project, Firebase, gcloud commands).

How to run locally.

How to deploy.

Key features and how to interact with the app.

Success Criteria: Application is fully deployed, all core features work as expected, and basic documentation is available.
